## User stories:

    and continues until the game is finished or the restart button is clicked.

    - The user can see there is a restart button which can be clicked anytime during the game, which reloads the page, resetting 
    the timer, counter and shuffles the cards.

- As a user, I want a victory popup message to tell me when I've finished the game, displaying how many moves I made and the time it took
for me to finish the game. The timer and counter stops. It should also have a button to play the game again.
    - The user will see that a popup message appears when all the cards are matched congratulating the player and displaying the time it took
    to finish and how many moves they made, corresponding to the point at where the timer and counter stops.

- As a user, I want to see interesting and fun images some easy to memorise and some not so easy.
    - The user will find some of the images are similar so will find it harder to memorise and others quite easy and distinct from 
    the other images and easier to memorise.

- As a user, I want simple instructions.
    - The user will find just under the main heading the one sentenced instruction on how to play the game.

- As a user, I want to challenge my brain and exercise my memory.
    - The user will find it will help them with their memory so therefore challenge their brain when they keep playing as the cards 
    are re-shuffled each time it restarts.

# Responsiveness of website KEEP IT CONCISE!!! A FEW LINES EACH.

## [Index.html](https://karzuin.github.io/MS2/) in Desktop view.

In desktop mode, the heading and instructions is clear ,well spaced out and centred on the page. 
The card deck is well spaced and centred on the page.
Next, the scoreboard is also well spaced, clear and centred on the page.

When the cards are clicked the timer begins and continues and the counter registers the first move and continues to count as more clicks are pressed.
After two cards have been selected the user has to wait for them to flip back before they can click another card.

When two cards are matched they do not flip over but stay visible so the user knows which are matched and also has the pleasure to look at the 
images too.

When all the cards are matched the timer and moves counter stop. A victory popup appears below the scoreboard to display 'Congratulations! Genius!' 
and displays in how many minutes and seconds they completed the game and how many moves they made. This information matches what it displays when 
the timer and counter stop. All the information within the popup is well spaced out and clear.

Both the restart button on the scoreboard and the play again button on the popup reloads the page, shuffling the cards, resets the timer and 
moves counter to zero and the popup disappears.

The restart button on the scoreboard works whenever it is clicked whether the game has started or finished and a blue border appears when it has 
been clicked.

The copyright information is also clear and centred at the bottom of the page.

## [Index.html](https://karzuin.github.io/MS2/) in iPhone X, 5, 6, 7, 8, Galaxy S5, Moto G4 view.

In mobile phone mode, the heading and instructions is clear, well spaced out and centred on the page. 
The card deck is well spaced. Originally in my wireframes I would have liked it to keep the 4 x 4 grid but then the size of the images would be too
small, so decided to keep the images bigger rather than keep the grid size, seems a more better user experience.

# Responsiveness on different browsers:

[Google Chrome](https://google.com) all the testing information has been tested on Chrome browser using DevTools.

[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/)
- **Bug**: Popup modal does not display the black border.

[Internet Explorer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/internet-explorer.aspx) 
- **Bug**: Does not support, the only thing that displays is the text.

[Safari](https://www.apple.com/uk/safari/) 
- **Bug**: The cards were flipping but showing the inverted image of use your brain image rather than 
the lego image, I had commented out code that the css browser validator autoprefixer told me was invalid.

- **Debugged**: I have uncommented them and the game works on safari now.

## Bugs whilst creating the website:

- **Bug**: Wanted the timer to stop when all the cards were matched and was trying to figure out how to do that.
- **Debugged**: But then realised it was redundant as I also wanted to have a victory popup modal when all the cards were matched displaying 
the time and how many moves made. When this was implemented it stops the timer as well.

- **Bug**: There was a blank space between the copyright info and the scoreboard, the popup modal was creating the white space found out from 
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6699759/how-to-insert-a-popup-modal-without-creating-unnecessary-white-space)
- **Debugged**: But decided to keep the white space as when the modal pops up it covers the images and after matching them all, I would like 
to see them all before I start again.

- **Bug**: Unable to find how to resize images in markdown so used html.

- **Bug**: If user doesn't scroll down then they don’t see the victory popup.
- **Debugged**: Put a solid border around it, so it will be visible when the game finishes as it appears just under the scoreboard.


## Bugs to be fixed:

- **Bug**: Popup modal does not display any border in Firefox browser.
- **Bug**: Internet Explorer browser does not support, the only thing that displays is the text.
